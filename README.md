### About Me

With over a decade of experience as a Unity Developer, I specialize in building robust systems that bring creative ideas to life—whether in multiplayer architecture, immersive experiences, or cutting-edge technology. My work bridges the gap between technical complexity and creative vision, driven by a passion for research, systems thinking, and continuous innovation.

I am dedicated to exploring the frontiers of AI, decentralization, blockchain, and the future of interactive systems. I enjoy transforming challenges into opportunities and am always eager to collaborate on projects that push boundaries and shape what’s next in technology.
